# Description

Software update systems for automobiles promise huge benefits at the cost of potential security vulnerabilities. No existing solution considers more advanced security objectives such as resilience against a repository compromise, selective blocking of update traffic by a MITM, or compromise at a supplierâ€™s site.

To address this, we designed Uptane, a software update framework for automobiles that counters a comprehensive array of security attacks and that is resilient to partial compromises. Uptane addresses automotive specific vulnerabilities and limitations. Uptane is flexible and easy to adopt for industry stakeholders. Design details were developed together with the main automotive industry stakeholders in the USA.

In a future demonstration, we will show various attack scenarios, and how the attacks are prevented by Uptane.

Uptane is a collaboration between the New York University Tandon School of Engineering (NYU), the University of Michigan's Transport Research Institute (UMTRI), and the Southwest Research Institute (SWRI).
